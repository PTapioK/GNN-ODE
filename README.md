# GNN-ODE
Continuous time extension to Interaction Networks

Uses <cite>[Neural Ordinary Differential Equations][1]</cite> to make <cite>[Interaction Networks][2]</cite> continuous time.

Neural ODE framework is implemented in https://github.com/rtqichen/torchdiffeq. The Interaction Networks implementation used in this work is based on one found from https://github.com/higgsfield/interaction_network_pytorch. Bouncing balls simulator is taken from https://github.com/stelzner/Visual-Interaction-Networks.
